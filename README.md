## üìñ Summary

This is a graphical interface for the Universal Android Debloater, built from the ground up in Rust with `egui` for a fast, responsive, and cross-platform experience. It aims to improve privacy and battery performance by making it easy to remove unnecessary and obscure system apps. This can also contribute to improving security by reducing the device's [attack surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_surface).

Packages are documented as well as possible to provide a better understanding of what you can safely remove. The worst issue that could happen is removing an essential system package needed during boot, causing an unfortunate bootloop. **Make a backup first!** After about 5 failed system boots, the phone will automatically enter recovery mode, where you may need to perform a factory reset.

In any case, you **CANNOT** permanently brick your device with this software!

## üõ†Ô∏è How To Use It

#### Step 1: Prepare Your Phone

1.  **Backup Your Data!** You can never be too careful. Use your phone manufacturer's backup tool or any other method you prefer.
2.  **Enable Developer Options:** On your smartphone, go to `Settings > About Phone` and tap on `Build Number` 7 times.
3.  **Enable USB Debugging:** Find the new `Developer Options` menu in your settings and turn on `USB Debugging`.
4.  **(Optional but Recommended)** Disconnect from any OEM accounts (e.g., Samsung Account, Mi Account). Sometimes, removing an account package can cause issues on the lockscreen.

#### Step 2: Use the Application

1.  **Download UAD-Rust:** Grab the latest executable for your operating system from the [**Releases Page**](https://github.com/Md-Siam-Mia-Code/UAD-Universal-Android-Debloater/releases).
2.  **Connect Your Phone:** Connect your device to your computer with a USB cable. A prompt will appear on your phone asking you to "Allow USB debugging". Check "Always allow from this computer" and tap "Allow".
3.  **Launch UAD-Rust:** Run the downloaded executable.
4.  **Detect and List Packages:**
    - Click **`1. Detect Device`**. The log panel should show your device's serial number.
    - Click **`2. List Packages`**. The main panel will populate with all the system apps found on your device that are on the debloat lists.
5.  **Select and Uninstall:**
    - Use the **Search** and **Filter** options on the left to find packages.
    - Click the checkbox next to any package you wish to remove.
    - When ready, click the **`Uninstall Selected (#)`** button.
6.  **Reboot:** Once finished, you can click **`Reboot Device`** to restart your phone.

> **IMPORTANT NOTE:** You may need to run this software again after your phone receives a major system update (from your OEM), as some uninstalled system apps might be reinstalled.
